  The story behind building DuckyFlix â€” from scraping IMDB and experimenting with APIs to improving UI, integrating AI search with Gemini, and deploying on Vercel.

Technology has always fascinated me because of its power to transform ideas into reality.  
Every project I take on feels like a new chapter â€” a chance to learn, to make mistakes, and to create something that didnâ€™t exist before.  

A few months ago, I began a journey that would challenge me in new ways: building a movie streaming platform of my own. What started as inspiration from a friendâ€™s small project gradually turned into **[DuckyFlix](https://ducky.samirb.com.np/)**, a platform that combines scraping, APIs, and AI-powered search.

## How It Started  
Around three months ago, my friend **Milan Bhandari** created a simple movie streaming site by scraping **Soap2Day**. His project used:  

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js, Cheerio, and Axios  
- **Extras:** Scraped some [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) data  

The project was simple but effective, and it inspired me. I thought, *why not try something bigger, cleaner, and cooler?*  

I already had some knowledge of scraping and reverse engineering, so I decided to take the challenge seriously.  

## Scraping IMDB and TMDB  
My first goal was to scrape the **entire [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) dataset** â€” not just basics, but:  

- Search functionality  
- Full details of every title  
- Trending and popular content  
- News and updates  

Since [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) is mostly static, **Cheerio** worked perfectly for scraping, giving me a lightweight backend.  

I also integrated the **[TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)**, which is the second biggest movie database. This made the backend even stronger.  

## Streaming Solution  
I wasnâ€™t in a position to host every movie on my own CDN â€” the cost would have been impossible.  

Instead, I relied on public streaming providers:  

- [VidSrc](https://vidsrc.xyz/)  
- [SuperEmbed](https://www.superembed.stream/)  

They handle hosting for free, and I simply embed their players (with ads) for movies and series.  

## Choosing Next.js & Vercel  
For the frontend, I went with **Next.js**, hosted on **Vercel**. The reason was simple:  
Vercel provides the best support and stability for Next.js projects.  

At first, though, my **UI was awful**. People didnâ€™t like it, and honestly, neither did I. I was too focused on backend logic.  

To improve, I used:  

- **[Cursor AI IDE](https://www.cursor.com/)**  
- **[V0 by Vercel](https://v0.dev/)**  

These helped me enhance the design and polish the user experience.  

## Continuous Updates & AI Features  
I committed to **constantly updating** the project. Every commit brought improvements, fixes, or experiments.  

One thing I noticed: most streaming sites had only a *basic search feature*.  

That gave me an idea â€” why not build something smarter?  

So, I integrated **[Googleâ€™s Gemini AI](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/node_quickstart)** into [DuckyFlix](https://ducky.samirb.com.np/). By feeding it all my backend APIs, I designed an **AI-powered search and recommendation system**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Check it here: [AI Recommendations](https://ducky.samirb.com.np/ai-recommendation)  

Now, instead of plain search results, users get **smart, context-aware suggestions**.  

## Still in Progress  
[DuckyFlix](https://ducky.samirb.com.np/) is far from finished. Iâ€™m still working on improving performance, polishing the UI, and exploring new features.  

But looking back, Iâ€™ve learned so much already â€” from scraping and APIs to frontend design, AI integration, and deployment.  

This journey started with inspiration from a friendâ€™s small project, but itâ€™s becoming something bigger: a platform where I can experiment, learn, and build.  

And the journey continues... ðŸš€
