description: A deep dive into my lifelong fascination with technology, from humble beginnings in a remote Nepali village to embracing AI and web development in the bustling streets of Kathmandu. It's a story of curiosity, mistakes, and relentless pursuit.

> This is my personal blog where I share my thoughts, experiences, and journey with technology. From growing up in a remote village to exploring AI, web development, and programming, I write about the lessons I’ve learned, the mistakes I’ve made, and the projects that have shaped my curiosity and ambition.

## Early Days in Kailali  
I still remember the day electricity first reached our village in Kailali, Sudurpashchim.  
Before that, life moved at a gentle, analog pace: letters, landlines, and the patient rhythm of rural days.  

When the power finally came — not as a sweeping promise, but as the furtive, joyful result of collective requests from our neighbors — something small and wild woke up in me.  

A keypad phone in a neighbor’s hand felt like a miracle: a little box that could shrink distance, carry voices, and change lives. That box felt like possibility itself.  

## Childhood Curiosity  
My family soon got one of those phones, and for a child who had seen so little of the world, it was intoxicating. Later came touchscreens — songs, videos, games, whole worlds in glass.  

I begged my father to let me use a smartphone, but he refused. He feared distraction and wanted me to focus on studies. I respected him, but that refusal only sharpened my curiosity into a stubborn hunger.  

## First Encounter with Computers  
The real turning point was school. In fourth or fifth grade, my teacher introduced a subject called *computer*.  

The first time I heard the word *internet*, I was stunned — what is this invisible thing that connects everything? My teacher patiently explained websites, browsers, and social media.  

That evening, I begged my mother to let me use her phone for homework. She agreed. On that first day of freedom, I spent all her phone balance within minutes — a clumsy, expensive crash-course in data and mobile packages.  

She scolded me, but I owned the mistake. That episode taught me something priceless: **mistakes are part of the journey.**

## Growing with Technology  
Schooldays became a place where my fascination met practice. I poured myself into computer studies and consistently topped the subject. I devoured books from my brother and seniors, tinkered endlessly, and discovered the thrill of programming — lines of text that could make a machine do anything.  

## COVID and the Wi-Fi Era  
When COVID-19 struck and schools shut down, our village got its first Wi-Fi. My family was among the first to subscribe.  

With more time and a connection to the wider world, I dove deeper. Discord, Telegram, and their bots fascinated me. Watching a bot execute commands instantly felt like discovering a lever that could move parts of society.  

I wanted to pull that lever.  

## Learning by Building  
I taught myself Node.js and Python to create bots for Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp. I explored frontend work with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind, and dabbled in C for low-level concepts.  

GitHub became my second library. I read code, forked projects, and built my own repositories. APIs, reverse engineering, scraping, deployment, debugging — each was a challenge I embraced.  

Two lessons defined this period:  

1. **Self-study habits.** I learned by reading docs, watching YouTube tutorials, asking in forums, and studying real projects. Errors became teachers; bugs became puzzles.  
2. **Project-first learning.** Instead of theory in isolation, I built things. Bots that automated tasks, APIs that fetched data, scrapers for information — each project made concepts real.  

## Reaching New Heights  
By class 10, while many peers worked with QBASIC, I was building bots and web services. When I finally got my first smartphone after passing class 10, it felt like a key to endless possibilities.  

Moving to Kathmandu for higher studies was humbling. Surrounded by other curious minds, I collaborated on APIs, contributed to projects, and explored web development and AI.  

## The AI Spark  
The arrival of ChatGPT and the modern AI era lit another fire. AI was not just a tool but a language: models, prompts, ethics, integrations. It accelerated my learning and gave direction to my ambition.  

## A More Mature Obsession  
Buying a stable laptop was a practical milestone. It allowed me to tackle bigger projects, learn version control, practice deployment, and collaborate globally.  

Over time, my obsession with technology has matured into something layered:  

- **Curiosity** — the spark from the first keypad phone.  
- **Agency** — the power to build tools for myself and others.  
- **Creativity** — turning ideas into working projects.  
- **Responsibility** — ensuring tech helps rather than harms.  
- **Ambition** — striving to study further, go abroad, and contribute meaningfully.  

## Looking Back, Looking Forward  
I still see the little village child who once wasted his mother’s phone balance. That child is now someone who reads docs, writes APIs, and experiments with AI.  

My dream is to bring what I learn back to villages like Kailali: better connectivity, educational tools, and tech that simplifies life.  

So why am I obsessed with technology?  
Because it turned possibility into practice for me.  

It transformed my world — from distant voices on a keypad phone to a global network of ideas I can now access, shape, and share.  

This obsession is unfinished. It’s a promise to keep learning, keep building, and use whatever I create to make life better for the people who matter most.
